# Data Sources
The following files are used as input:
* Activity data: train/Y_train.txt, test/Y_test.txt
* Subject data: train/subject_train.txt, test/subject_test.txt
* Features: train/X_train.txt, test/X_test.txt
* Feature names: features.txt
* Activity labels: activity_labels.txt

The variables are mean and standard deviation variables from the input feature vector (i.e. a subset), with the following convention:
* "-mean()-" denotes mean variable
* "-std()-" denotes a standard deviation variable
* "-X", "-Y", and "-Z" suffix denotes measurement in X, Y, and Z axis, respectively
* "freq" prefix denotes frequency measurement of the feature
* "time" prefix denotes time measurement of the feature
